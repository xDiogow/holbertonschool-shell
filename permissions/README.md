# Permissions - Shell Scripting

This directory contains a series of shell scripts that manage file and directory permissions, ownership, and group settings. The exercises cover user switching, displaying user information, modifying file modes, and more. Each script is designed to help you master file permissions and ownership management in Unix-like systems.
